# Candy Beamer Theme

This is a **simple** and **clear** beamer theme for academic and scientific presentations. We used the predefined colors Apricot, Melon and Peach to create a smooth and pleasant composition of tasteful colors to pleasure the eye of the spectator. As these fruits reminded us of our favorite candies, the name of the theme was born in the same moment we thought about them.
